    "    Using SQLlitte with three different clients, I was able to merge the data gathered over the past two months. We had three different databases of about 500K rows each, and now they're merged.\n",
    "    After a lot of pain, I found https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/#!/area/get_area, which allowed me to final get the county and the state.\n",
    "        Multiple problems here - first, for 1.7KK rows, how many requests would that be?\n",
    "        The requests of are in shape of https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/area?lat=33.451209&lon=-79.122849&format=json, and return multiple results, which one to accept?\n",
    "        Some of the data we have is not from the US, so we have to handle that too, probably delete any outsider entries.\n",
    "            We will remove any raws with empty FIPs\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I was planning to remove empty lats/lons in Pandas, but for efficiency, I removed it in SQL so that I don't waste time dealing with that edge case in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remove entries without state in Pandas => state_name == \"FAILED\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    It truly is slow. The whole process. 1,700,000 rows will take a lot of time. I have to use multitasking.\n",
